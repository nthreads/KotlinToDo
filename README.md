It’s a good alternative to Java that can also work along with Java in parallel in a single Android app. Compared to Java, it is much more concise and it has a stronger null safety, meaning that you can catch potential crashes much earlier in your development cycle. Kotlin has a lot of built-in boilerplate code, making development faster and less error-prone. The Android community has been very excited about Kotlin and I believe that Android will move quickly to Kotlin. So, it will be right to say that;
